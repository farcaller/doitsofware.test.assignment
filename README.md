# doitsofware.test.assignment
Test assignment from DoIt.software


Mistakes in this test assignement:
1) On screen edit task button "Save" is missed
2) DB interaction: unique key for each record moved to mobile application. I beleive it should be on server side.
3) On the Edit screen missed Date due value
4) On API side priority is text instead of been coded like 1-low 2-medium 3-high + default value is missed.
